# Project Management Application

A full-stack personal project built using Next.js and MySQL, designed to challenge myself by developing an unknown type of project with no initial design. The goal was to create something cool while learning along the way. This project manages users, tasks, and projects, with a dashboard interface to interact with all functionalities.
